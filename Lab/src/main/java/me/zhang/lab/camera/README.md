The general steps for creating a custom camera interface for your application are as follows:

1. Detect and Access Camera - Create code to check for the existence of cameras and request access.
2. Create a Preview Class - Create a camera preview class that extends SurfaceView and implements the SurfaceHolder interface. This class previews the live images from the camera.
3. Build a Preview Layout - Once you have the camera preview class, create a view layout that incorporates the preview and the user interface controls you want.
4. Setup Listeners for Capture - Connect listeners for your interface controls to start image or video capture in response to user actions, such as pressing a button.
5. Capture and Save Files - Setup the code for capturing pictures or videos and saving the output.
6. Release the Camera - After using the camera, your application must properly release it for use by other applications.

Caution: Remember to release the Camera object by calling the Camera.release() when your application is done using it! If your application does not properly release the camera, all subsequent attempts to access the camera, including those by your own application, will fail and may cause your or other applications to be shut down.
